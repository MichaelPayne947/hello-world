# hello-world
Basic files for my projects
My name is Michael Payne and I'm a 19 year-old student at Massey University. I have just recently picked up an interest in programming and have started on an online course on codecademy.com. I am learning basic HTML5 and CSS3 and will then move onto learning Javascript and then Java. One I feel confident in these languages and am capable enough to do my own mini projects, I would like to leaern python, C#, C++, PHP and Ruby.
